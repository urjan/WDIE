Well, If you are super-organized, prep and cook your meals, this isn't for you. 

If you are a super-busy and a lazy student like me and eat most of your meals outside, one of those things you ask yourself, like a 100 times a day is, WHERE DO I EAT!?

Fret not, a button click on your beloved phone will save you the torment of deciding where to eat.


Features:
- Click a button, tells you where to eat.
- If you ate there yesterday, don't worry, we won't ask you to go there again today!
- If you ate there like three times in the last 10 days, again, do not worry, we wont ask you to go there.
- You can give a bunch of options that you have, so you can go to a place where you wouldn't mind eating.
